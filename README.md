# How it works?

  its uses Google Maps API to display a Map, and FourSquare API to get places info. It has also a list component that display a List of Places, and a Search Filter. Just Click on any place from the list and it would trigger its Marker on the Map and give you the whole info about it :)

# Production Instructions

  npm build or yarn build
  This will build the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


# Offline First
  The service worker is only enabled in the production environment. It's recommended that you do not enable an offline-first service worker in a development environment.
  If you need to test your offline-first service worker locally, build the application (using npm run build) and run a simple http server from your build directory.
